		 * 		THIS IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN board.GetPieceAt(from)
		 * 
		 * 2: Determine if/what piece is in "from" square. Return CMVException if no piece on "from" square
		 * 3: Use the piece's move restrictions to determine if it is able to get to "to" square
		 *    Note - this will also consider other pieces on the board and pieces in the path of the target piece
		 *    
		 *    POTENTIAL METHOD IN EACH CLASS?
		 *       This class would have a function of validMove for each piece. This is where the rules for 
		 *       each type of piece will go. Using this strat will allow for a new class to be made if 
		 *       for some reason a new piece was to be added to the game
		 *     
		 *    POTENTIAL LAMBDA
		 *    	 Create a lambda for each piece that will access an interface with canMove
		 *    	 Each of these lambdas would call from a "Validate" functional interface, 
		 *    	 and be implemented in ActualChessPiece
		 *    	 The function will call validate on the piece that is in square "from"  
		 *    
		 * 4: Return true if the move is valid. Return false otherwise
