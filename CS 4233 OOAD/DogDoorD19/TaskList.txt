TASK LIST
=========

DD1:
When the dog owner initializes the system the following occurs:
• The dog door is put in the closed position if it is not already there.
• The system is ready to accept signals from the remote.

If there are any errors on initialization, the system makes three attempts to initialize. 
If after the third retry (fourth attempt) the error persists, the system halts and must 
be restarted (possibly after repairs).

	xT3-1: 1 failure and then success
	xT3-2: 2 failures and then success
	xT3-3: 3 failures and then success
	xT3-4: 4 failures, throw an exception (or exit)
